# ElevenLabs Audio Generator

Generate music, sound effects, and voice clips via ElevenLabs, preview in a grouped browser player.

## Setup

`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` must be set in `.env`

## Audio Types

### Music

```bash
bash scripts/generate.sh <output_dir>/music "<prompt>" [duration_seconds] [prompt_influence]
```

- `duration_seconds`: 0.5 to 30 (optional, API guesses if omitted)
- `prompt_influence`: 0 to 1, default 0.3 (higher = closer to prompt)
- Be specific: genre, mood, tempo, instruments, "no vocals"

### Sound Effects

```bash
bash scripts/generate.sh <output_dir>/sfx "<prompt>" [duration_seconds] [prompt_influence]
```

Same API as music, just describe sounds instead of music. Good for: whooshes, clicks, ambient, UI sounds, impacts.

### Voice

```bash
bash scripts/generate_voice.sh <output_dir>/voice "<text>" [voice_id] [model_id]
```

- Default voice: Sarah (EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL)
- Default model: eleven_flash_v2_5
- Common voices: Roger (CwhRBWXzGAHq8TQ4Fs17), Charlie (IKne3meq5aSn9XLyUdCD), George (JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb), River (SAz9YHcvj6GT2YYXdXww)

## Player

Build the grouped player (music/sfx/voice sections with different accent colors):

```bash
bash scripts/player.sh <base_dir> <output_html>
```

Expected directory structure:
```
<base_dir>/
├── music/*.mp3   (green accent)
├── sfx/*.mp3     (yellow accent)
└── voice/*.mp3   (blue accent)
```

Any category dir that exists gets included. Missing dirs are skipped.

## Workflow

1. Generate tracks in parallel (one call per track, run with `&` and `wait`)
2. Organize into `music/`, `sfx/`, `voice/` subdirs
3. Build the player: `bash scripts/player.sh <base_dir> <output_html>`
4. Serve: `cd <base_dir> && nohup python3 -m http.server <port> > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
5. Expose: `bash skills/cloudflare-tunnel/scripts/tunnel.sh start <port>`
6. Send tunnel URL. User previews, selects favorites, asks for more.
