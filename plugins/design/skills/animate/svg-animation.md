# SVG Animation

Recipes for animating SVG (line-drawing, rotation, path morphing, ambient motion). Load from [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) when animating vector art. All values from the *Animations on the Web* course.

## Fundamentals

- SVG is coordinate-based with no document flow — unpositioned elements stack at `(0,0)`.
- **`viewBox="minX minY width height"`** is the camera; it enables responsive scaling and lets you keep animation values consistent at any display size (the course hero uses `viewBox="0 0 622 319"`).
- **Path commands:** `M` move (no draw), `L` line, `Z` close. Uppercase = absolute, lowercase = relative. **Always close paths with `Z`** — an unclosed path where start meets end shows an awkward corner.
- **Degenerate shapes don't render at all** — `width="0"`, `r="0"`, or a line whose start equals its end vanish entirely (unlike `opacity:0`/`fill:transparent`, where the shape still exists).
- Put `overflow: visible` on the `<svg>` so overshoot/scale doesn't clip. Nest `<g>` groups to layer independent transforms on one element.

## Line-drawing (self-drawing stroke)

Reveal a stroke as if it's being drawn by animating `stroke-dashoffset`:

1. Set `stroke-dasharray` so the dash equals the full path length and the gap is large (only one dash shows).
2. Offset by the path length to hide it.
3. Animate the offset back to `0` to draw it in.

```css
path { stroke-dasharray: 1px 1.1px; stroke-dashoffset: 1px; animation: draw 0.6s ease forwards; }
@keyframes draw { to { stroke-dashoffset: 0; } }
```

- **`pathLength="100"`** on the path normalizes its length so you work in round numbers / percentages and can share values across paths of different real lengths.
- **`animation-fill-mode: forwards` is required** or the shape snaps back to hidden.
- **Stagger** multiple strokes with `animation-delay` (a checkmark waits for its box: `draw 0.4s …; animation-delay: 0.6s`).
- **`stroke-linecap: round` gotcha:** rounded caps extend past the mathematical dash, so make the gap slightly larger than the dash (`1px` dash, `1.1px` gap) or the caps peek through when the line should be hidden.

## Rotation & transform-origin (the SVG trap)

**`transform-origin` in SVG defaults to the viewBox `(0,0)`, and `center` means the center of the viewBox** — not the element. Fix it one of two ways:

```css
/* Preferred: make origin relative to the element's own box (HTML-like) */
.el { transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center; }

/* Or: keep viewBox coordinates and rotate around a specific point */
.hand { transform-origin: 50px 50px; } /* clock center of a 100×100 viewBox */
```

For a zero-thickness line's bounding box, `transform-origin: 0% 100%` hits the start point (the zero dimension ignores its percentage).

**In Framer Motion, SVG elements get `transform-box: fill-box` and `transform-origin: 50% 50%` by default, and Motion overrides a `transformOrigin` set in `style` back to `50% 50%`.** Set it in the **`initial`** prop instead:

```jsx
<motion.g initial={{ transformOrigin: "76.3px 69.5px" }} style={{ transformBox: "view-box" }}
          animate={{ rotate: 360 }} transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 250, damping: 25, mass: 1.2 }} />
```

Use `transform-box: view-box` + pixel `transformOrigin` to rotate a group around a distant point (e.g. bells around a clock's center).

## Path morphing

Animate a path's `d` between two shapes — only works when both paths share point structure:

```jsx
const progress = useMotionValue(0);
const d = useTransform(progress, [0, 1], [handOpenPath, handClosedPath]);
// <motion.path d={d} />  — animate progress [0, 1, 0] = open → click → open
```

If the two paths differ in structure, use **flubber** to interpolate.

## Shakes & multi-step motion (keyframes)

Reach for keyframes (an array of values) for shakes, pulses, and press feedback — decaying, alternating-sign values:

```jsx
// bell shake — rotate keyframes, large→small, alternating
animate={{ rotate: [0, 20, -15, 12.5, -10, 10, -7.5, 7.5, -5, 5, 0] }}
// press feedback — compress → overshoot → settle
animate={{ transform: ["scale(1)", "scale(0.97)", "scale(1.01)", "scale(1)"] }}
// continuous hover jitter
animate={{ x: ["0px", "-1.5px", "1.75px", "-1.75px", "1.75px", "-1.5px", "0px"] }}
transition={{ ease: "linear", repeat: Infinity, duration: 0.25 }}
```

Put the rotate on a wrapping `<g>`/div so nested decorations shake "for free."

## Ambient "subtle life"

Make idle scenes feel alive with barely-perceptible looping motion, and **use non-syncing durations** so layers never line up (that's what makes it read organic, not mechanical):

```jsx
// float: translateY 0 → 1.5px over 3s;  rotate: 0 → 2deg over 4s
transition={{ ease: "easeInOut", repeat: Infinity, repeatType: "reverse" }}
```

Give idle/attention loops an initial `delay` (~2s) so users discover interactions first, and a `repeatDelay` between plays. Await line/path resets before restarting a loop to avoid conflicts.

## Performance for busy SVG scenes

Many simultaneously-animating SVG elements (especially with filters) can drop frames. Promote only the animated ones — **after** you see jank, not preemptively:

```css
svg [data-animate]      { will-change: transform, opacity, stroke-dashoffset; contain: layout style paint; }
svg .filter-animated    { will-change: transform; transform: translateZ(0); }
```

`contain: layout style paint` isolates an element's rendering so it doesn't repaint siblings; `translateZ(0)` forces a GPU layer for expensive filtered/blur elements. Target `[data-animate]`, not every node — too many GPU layers cost memory.

## Reduced motion

For decorative SVG scenes, reduced motion is **all or nothing** — disable float, rotation, hover, and click so the asset is fully static (keeping the float would falsely imply it's interactive). Gate with `useReducedMotion()` (return identical `initial`/`animate`, or early-return the handlers).
